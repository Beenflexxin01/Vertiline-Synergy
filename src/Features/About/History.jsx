          <p className="text-description">
            Vertiline Synergy Limited was established in 2012 as an events
            production company. It quickly branched into other businesses in the
            hospitality industry, specializing in Dry Cleaning / Laundry, and
            Catering Services. With our increasing knowledge in the food and
            beverage industry, we have set up and operated various types of
            restaurants and food kitchen across Nigeria. In the course of doing
            business, we realized that many businesses lack the proper knowledge
            and information needed before venturing into the hospitality
            industry, which in the end, the business eventually fails.
